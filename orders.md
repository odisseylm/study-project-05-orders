What is Good 'Til Canceled (GTC)
(from https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gtc.asp)

Good â€™til canceled (GTC) describes a type of order that an investor may place to buy or sell a security
that remains active until either the order is filled or the investor cancels it.
Brokerages will typically limit the maximum time you can keep a GTC order open (active) to 90 days.

A GTC order may be contrasted with an immediate or cancel (IOC) order.

 - A Good 'til Cancelled (GTC) order is an order that is working regardless of the time frame,
   until the order is explicitly cancelled.
 - Traders may use GTC orders to cut down on day-to-day management of their portfolio.
 - Risks associated with GTC orders include execution of orders at inopportune moments,
   such as the brief rally in prices or temporary volatility. The consequent fallback in prices could leave traders with losses.
