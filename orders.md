From [3 Order Types: Market, Limit and Stop Orders](https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/3-order-types-market-limit-and-stop-orders)

 - **Market order** - is an order to buy or sell a stock at the market's current best available price.
   A market order typically ensures an execution, but it does not guarantee a specified price.
 - **Limit order** - is an order to buy or sell a stock with a restriction on the maximum price to be paid  
   or the minimum price to be received (the "limit price").
   If the order is filled, it will only be at the specified limit price or better. However, there is no assurance of execution.
 - **Stop order** - is an order to buy or sell a stock at the market price once the stock has traded at or through
   a specified price (the "stop price"). If the stock reaches the stop price, the order becomes a market order
   and is filled at the next available market price. If the stock fails to reach the stop price, the order is not executed.

What is Good 'Til Canceled (GTC)
(from https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gtc.asp)

Good â€™til canceled (GTC) describes a type of order that an investor may place to buy or sell a security
that remains active until either the order is filled or the investor cancels it.
Brokerages will typically limit the maximum time you can keep a GTC order open (active) to 90 days.

A GTC order may be contrasted with an immediate or cancel (IOC) order.

 - A Good 'til Cancelled (GTC) order is an order that is working regardless of the time frame,
   until the order is explicitly cancelled.
 - Traders may use GTC orders to cut down on day-to-day management of their portfolio.
 - Risks associated with GTC orders include execution of orders at inopportune moments,
   such as the brief rally in prices or temporary volatility. The consequent fallback in prices could leave traders with losses.
